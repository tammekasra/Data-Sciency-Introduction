5.2

These charts are taken from Twitter posts about U.S statistics.
-In the first chart we clearly see that clearly that there are no description for X and Y axis (the data should be about tax and income)
-Second bar chart is simply bad because the viewer can not see the differences between murders in 2018 and 2019 (is it little bit higher or lower?)
-Third graph - The U.S to Europe travels should have it's own seperate graph simply because it is much lowers than the rest it is hard to depict what is happening in each month

(Sadly I couldn't find a way to make the graphs better or implement them since there were no available data for it.... except a graph post on Twitter)
